Question 1:
This repository was created, so it is able to make commit and therefore see the history of my files
->I can track my steps

Question 2:
Staging area is only temporary. The files are only in till the commit will be performed
Pro: You have the ability to chosen which files you want to save

Question 3:
You can compare the files from the staging area and from the last commit, so you can see the changes therein

Question 4:
Branches can be helpful, if you are not sure whether you should keep the changes

Question 5:
A diagramm (here: graph) display the branches and shows when they were made. 

Question 6:
If someone merges two branches the code in the different files is combined.
It is represented in this way, since after a merge only one branch exists

Question 7:
Pros: Automatic is faster; Git is pretty intelligent at chosing which code to use
Cons: There may be mistakes
